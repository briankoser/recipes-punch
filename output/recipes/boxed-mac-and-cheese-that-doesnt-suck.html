            Ingredients:
            <ul>
            
                <li property="ingredients">2 Boxes of Mac &amp; Cheese</li>
            
                <li property="ingredients">Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
            
                <li property="ingredients">Diced Onions (a couple handfuls)</li>
            
                <li property="ingredients">Plain yogurt or sour cream</li>
            
                <li property="ingredients">Milk</li>
            
                <li property="ingredients">1 lb. bacon, fried crisp</li>
            
                <li property="ingredients">1 tomato, chopped</li>
            
            </ul>
            
            Instructions:
            <ol property="recipeInstructions">
            
                <li>Cook the elbows, but make sure you don&#x27;t overcook - use the LOW end of the time range on the box.</li>
            
                <li>While those elbows are draining in a colander, cover the bottom of the same pan with olive oil (don&#x27;t be too shy, but I use less oil than the amount of butter recommended on the box).</li>
            
                <li>Dump those diced onions in there and lower the heat to medium.  We just want to get them barely translucent, so they lend a sweetness and no heat.</li>
            
                <li>I put the elbows back in the pan at this point, and stir them up for a minute to get them hot and lubed.</li>
            
                <li>Dump the box&#x27;s cheese mix in, along with about two tablespoons of the yogurt (just eyeball it) and enough milk to loosen things up. I like to toss in some black pepper at this point, as much for the nose as for the tongue.</li>
            
                <li>Stir on the heat until all the powder is melted and mixed. Add more milk/yogurt to get the consistency you want. Stir in bacon and tomato and serve.</li>
            
            </ol>
